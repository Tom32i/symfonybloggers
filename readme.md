# Symfony Bloggers RSS Feed

This is a "repository" of RSS / Atom feeds of people blogging about symfony. If you wish to add your feed to the list, you can ping me here, or on twitter (@khepin), or by any other means that you like. Or fork this repository, modify the feed_list to add your feed url and send a pull request.

Once this is done, all feeds are merged into a common one that can be found [here](http://feeds.feedburner.com/sfbloggers). This way you can follow everything that is happening in the Symfony community in an easy way.
